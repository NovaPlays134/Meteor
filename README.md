# Meteor
Meteor is originally an 2take1 script i recoded everything i could or was not risky for online.

# Installation
drop everything in Lua Script in the stand folder and you are set


# Please Read
this is the 2take1 Meteor script i recoded it and removed ALOT options bc they were banable bc the latest version of this script was around a half year back and there were alot of money drop options or give rp
options that i didnt want to mess with also alot logging i also didnt do bc useless tbh also alot of spawn maps etc options removed bc we got contructor script already for stand thats way better also like 500 line
code with crashes that i RLLY didnt wanna mess with ban reasons whatever you know the shit also some stuff that just isnt posible with out mod api thats basicly it so this is kinda the smaller version of the origial
with all options i could recode and didnt leave out bc useless, to risky, isnt even posible anymore with gta itself

i got permision of the original owner of the script (RulyPancake) and alot credit to him hes a amazing coder
so yeah i hope u injoy of what i made--
